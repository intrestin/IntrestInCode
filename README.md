###[An introduction to the source code](http://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/An-Introduction-to-the-Diaspora-Source)
###[Issue tracker (bugs)](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues) - Currently going through major cleanup
###[How to use git](http://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Git-Workflow)

Here are a few good places to start:

- Run "rake spec" to run our [Rspec](http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/2007/05/14/an-introduction-to-rspec-part-i/) 
unit test suite.

- Run "rake cucumber" to run our [Cucumber](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/10/05/outside-in-development/)
integration test suite.

- Take a look at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues) and pick a bug.
Write a spec for it, so it's easy for another developer to fix it.

Catches must be tested, and all your tests should be green, 
unless you're marking an existing bug, before a pull request is sent.
Unit tests should be in Rspec, and integration tests should be in Cucumber.

Please make your changes in a branch to ensure that new commits to your master are 
not included in the pull request, and to make it easier for us to merge your commits.

Please do not rebase our tree into yours.
See [here](http://www.mail-archive.com/dri-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg39091.html)
for when to rebase.
